## Name: serverless-api-cqrs

## Description

The Serverless API CQRS service is designed to provide a scalable architecture for handling commands and queries using the CQRS pattern within a serverless environment. It leverages AWS Lambda and API Gateway for a cost-effective, scalable, and highly available solution.

## Usage

Generate a new NestJS application using the following npx command.

```bash
npx turbo gen serverless-api-cqrs
```

## Features

- CQRS Pattern: Implements Command and Query Responsibility Segregation for optimized data handling.
- Event-Driven: Uses events to handle state changes and ensure data consistency.
- The DBBS platform enables the generation of a NestJS application template with opinionated settings. This simplifies and accelerates the initial stages of development while promoting code consistency across different applications. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for streamlining updates to the common aspects of applications when the platform undergoes updates.
